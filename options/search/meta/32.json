Order is NOT enforced because it introduces significant risk of stuck finalizers. finalizers is a shared field, any actor with permission can reorder it. If the finalizer list is processed in order, then this can lead to a situation in which the component responsible for the first finalizer in the list is waiting for a signal (field value, external system, or other) produced by a component responsible for a finalizer later in the list, resulting in a deadlock. Without enforced ordering finalizers are free to order amongst themselves and are not vulnerable to ordering changes in the list.</p>","example":null,"read_only":false,"type":"null or (list of (string))","name":"applications.<name>.resources.\"discovery.k8s.io\".v1.EndpointSlice.<name>.metadata.finalizers"},{"declarations":["https://github.com/arnarg/nixidy/blob/main/modules/generated/k8s/v1.33.nix"],"default":null,"description":"<p>GenerateName is an optional prefix, used by the server, to generate a unique name ONLY IF the Name field has not been provided.
